Updated to do s for TASM project


I have a better understanding of how to include external files with procedures, macros, variables via external asm or .inc

First thing:
- Type up answer for TASM question on Stack Overflow
	- use external example
	- use .inc file example
	- use procedure prototype example
		- found in chatgpt chat practice program to make sure it works then add to post


Build out Journal application
Phase 1
- Figure out registers and segments and their responsibilities so it can lead to plug and play
- Start with rough display
- CRUD/Input Process Output

 Phase 2
- add cpp for graphics to the application
- create server in cpp 
- put application on there


That is a good program to start with
